# Donkey Kong in Console


![Menu](https://github.com/1mache/DonkeyKongCPP/blob/main/screenshots/menu.png)\

This project was done for our "Object Oriented Programming in C++" course in college. It is a copy of a well known arcade game that runs in your console :)

## Acknowledgements

 - [Premake5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core)
We put the premake exe file for windows in premake/ for convenience. [Here](https://premake.github.io/download) you can download premake for other OS.

## Building

Build the project by running:
```bash
  premake/premake5.exe vs2022
```
(if you're using VisualStudio2022)\
Or by executing build.bat (on Windows).\
This will create VisualStudio2022 project files inside DonkeyKong/ folder.

This was tested on Windows, but in theory you should be able to build the project files for your specified editor if premake supports it.
